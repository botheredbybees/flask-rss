**Learning a bit about flask (and Pycharm)**

This is a bit of a scratchpad for picking up some pycharm practice
using flask the python web framework.

If you want to reproduce the environment I used you'll need to start off with
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (I'm using 3.4.3)
- pip _`python get-pip.py`_
- virtualenv _`[sudo] pip install virtualenv`_
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) community edition

1. Create a new project and [set up a virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/creating-virtual-environment.html) for it to run in
2. Add Flask to the project's virtualenv using the + icon on _`File - Settings - Project - Project Interpreter`_
3. Install `feedparser` too
